Comments on Part a:
The limitation on part a is that it can only read a subset of special keyword 
in a shell script as asked in the instruction. Special keywords like >> and <&.
In other words, the shell script it is parsing has to be in the format that
the program can handle. Otherwise, undefined behavior may appear.

Comments on Part b:
No special features or limitations. It behaves the same as running the 
shell script itself. 

Comment on Part c:
We did not implement this part. 

Test cases:
In test1.sh
